 I used book?s ArrayQueue definition, derived two versions of a priority queue.  Thee
first is to make sure the queue is always sorted, so that the smallest element is always at the front.
The second is to leave the queue in its ?natural? arrival order and search for the smallest element
every time removeMin() is called. The first subclass is PriorityQueueSort and the second is PriorityQueueSearch.
