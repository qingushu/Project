This is a max heap structure

The constructor heapify the data argument (whichpoint at the first element of an array of integers, and the array's size should be given by size_t).

The queue method enqueue the argument in such a way that when dequeue is called, the elements will be dequeued in order; from the greatest integer to the lowest. The queue and dequeue methods both be O(log(n)).
